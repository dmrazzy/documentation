# PMS API Endpoints Documentation

## /oauth/client (GET)

**Description:** This endpoint retrieves a list of all OAuth clients created by the Auth Partners. It supports pagination, sorting, and and filtering based on optional query parameters. If the token used to access this endpoint, does not have the PARTNER_ADMIN role, then it will fetch all the OAuth clients created by all the partners associated with the logged in user only. If the token used to access this endpoint, has PARTNER_ADMIN role, then it will fetch all the OAuth clients created by all the partners. It is configured for **PARTNER_ADMIN** and **AUTH_PARTNER** roles.

**Changes done in release 1.2.2.0:** Newly added in release 1.2.2.0

**Changes done in release 1.3.0-beta.1:** No changes made in release 1.3.0-beta.1

**Changes done in release 1.3.0-beta.2:** Added input regex validation for the following fields: sortFieldName, sortType, partnerId, orgName, policyGroupName, policyName, clientName, status

**Changes done in release 1.3.0-beta.3:** No changes made in release 1.3.0-beta.3

## /oauth/client (POST)

**Description:** This endpoint is used for creating OIDC Client.

**Changes done in release 1.2.2.0:** 
1. Added validation to check the partner id in the request body belongs to the user who's token is being used to access this endpoint. This will ensure that PMS user can create OIDC client only for the partner id which belongs to the user. This validation is skipped if the user's role is **PARTNER_ADMIN**.

2. Added validation to check if the **Partner ID** used in the request body is active. This will ensure that OIDC client cannot be created for an inactive partner. ([MOSIP-34276](https://mosip.atlassian.net/browse/MOSIP-34276))

3. If multiple policy requests were created by the partner for a policy, then while creating the OIDC client, this endpoint was checking the status of only the first policy request. So even if there was an approved policy request, it was still throwing an error. Fixed this bug ([MOSIP-34599](https://mosip.atlassian.net/browse/MOSIP-34599))

4. Improved JWK validation for the public key by adding validation that n value (modulus value) of the JWK must be unique ([MOSIP-36219](https://mosip.atlassian.net/browse/MOSIP-36219))

5. Updated client name to be a JSON string to support client name language map ([ES-836](https://mosip.atlassian.net/browse/ES-836))

**Changes done in release 1.3.0-beta.1:** No changes made in release 1.3.0-beta.1

**Changes done in release 1.3.0-beta.3:** No changes made in release 1.3.0-beta.3

## /oauth/client/{client_id} (GET)

**Description:** This endpoint retrieves the OIDC client details by client id

**Changes done in release 1.2.2.0:** 
1. Added validation to check the partner id in the request belongs to the user who's token is being used to access this endpoint. This will ensure that PMS user can access OIDC client only for the partner id which belongs to the user. This validation is skipped if the user's role is **PARTNER_ADMIN**.

**Changes done in release 1.3.0-beta.1:** No changes made in release 1.3.0-beta.1

**Changes done in release 1.3.0-beta.2:** No changes made in release 1.3.0-beta.2

## /oauth/client/{client_id} (PUT)

**Description:** This endpoint is used for updating OIDC Client based on client id

**Changes done in release 1.2.2.0:** 
1. Added validation to check the partner id in the request body belongs to the user who's token is being used to access this endpoint. This will ensure that PMS user can update OIDC client only for the partner id which belongs to the user. This validation is skipped if the user's role is **PARTNER_ADMIN**.

2. Added validation to check if the **Partner ID** used in the request body is active. This will ensure that OIDC client cannot be updated for an inactive partner. This validation is skipped if the user's role is **PARTNER_ADMIN** and status in the request is changed to **INACTIVE**. ([MOSIP-34276](https://mosip.atlassian.net/browse/MOSIP-34276))

3. If the status in the request is changed to **INACTIVE**, only the status is updated in the database other fields remain unchanged. This will ensure that PUT endpoint can be used to deactivate the OIDC client.

4. Added a bypass for a user with **PARTNER_ADMIN** role. If the user with **PARTNER_ADMIN** role is used to access this endpoint, then it will deactivate the OIDC client for any partner ID, even if the partner ID is deactivated.

5. Added a validation to check if the OIDC client is already deactivated.([MOSIP-34108](https://mosip.atlassian.net/browse/MOSIP-34108))

6. Updated client name to be a JSON string to support client name language map ([ES-836](https://mosip.atlassian.net/browse/ES-836))
