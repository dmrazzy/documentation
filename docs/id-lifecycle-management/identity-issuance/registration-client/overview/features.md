# Features

The Registration Client provides a comprehensive, secure desktop
application for capturing resident identity data at registration
centers. This thick Java-based client enables operators to collect
demographic and biometric information along with supporting documents in
both online and offline modes. All captured data is cryptographically
secured and packaged into registration packets for tamper-proof
processing.

These features collectively address challenges like data security,
offline operations, multi-language support, and seamless integration
with MOSIP's identity ecosystem, resulting in efficient, secure, and
user-friendly identity registration operations.
