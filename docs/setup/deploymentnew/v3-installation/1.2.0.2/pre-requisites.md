## Certificate requirements

As only secured https connections are allowed via nginx server will need below mentioned valid ssl certificates:

* One valid wildcard ssl certificate related to domain used for accessing Observation cluster, this needs to be stored inside the nginx server VM for Observation cluster. In above e.g.: \*.org.net is the similar example domain.
* One valid wildcard ssl certificate related to domain used for accessing Mosip cluster, this needs to be stored inside the nginx server VM for mosip cluster. In above e.g.: \*.sandbox.xyz.net is the similar example domain.

## Personal computer requirements

* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)- any client version above 1.19
* [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)- any client version above 3.0.0 and add below repos as well:

```
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo add mosip https://mosip.github.io/mosip-helm
```

* [Istioctl](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#download) : version: 1.15.0
* [rke](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/installation/) : version: [1.3.10](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.3.10)
* \[Ansible]\(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation\_guide/intro\_installation.html: version > 2.12.4
*   Create a directory as mosip in your PC and:

    * clone k8’s infra repo with tag : 1.2.0.1 (**whichever is the latest version**) inside mosip directory. `git clone https://github.com/mosip/k8s-infra -b v1.2.0.1`
    * clone mosip-infra with tag : 1.2.0.1 (**whichever is the latest version**) inside mosip directory. `git clone https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra -b v1.2.0.1`
    * Set below mentioned variables in bashrc

    ```
    export MOSIP_ROOT=<location of mosip directory>
    export K8_ROOT=$MOSIP_ROOT/k8s-infra
    export INFRA_ROOT=$MOSIP_ROOT/mosip-infra
    ```

    `source .bashrc`

    > Note: Above mentioned environment variables will be used throughout the installation to move between one directory to other to run install scripts.
