# Privacy

## Overview

The right to privacy is a fundamental right in many contexts. Privacy protection or preservation can be ensured in an application by adopting a privacy friendly design stance.

## What is privacy and privacy protection?

Privacy takes many forms. From an identity system perspective, the confidentiality of identity information and anonymity when using the identity offers privacy.

MOSIP views the identity system as a custodian of the individual's data. This data has to be protected in order to protect the individual from privacy and security risks. Privacy protection measures include [data protection](data-protection.md), transparency, user control, confidentiality, selective disclosure, user anonymity and intrusion protection.

## Privacy design elements

MOSIP addresses privacy design at four levels.

### 1. Functional Privacy

Functional Privacy ensures the system is designed to process and expose only the data necessary for a specific function. It embodies data minimization and protects individuals from unnecessary data collection and exposure.

By embedding this principle, MOSIP achieves:

- 📉 Minimal data exposure across system components
- 🔒 Robust protection against unauthorized access and misuse
- 🛡️ Compliance with privacy principles like data minimization and purpose limitation
- 🌐 Alignment with global data privacy standards (e.g., GDPR, DPDP Act)

MOSIP achieves Functional Privacy through the following key mechanisms:

- Selective Disclosure
  - **What it is**  -Selective disclosure is the principle of limiting the data shared with different system components or relying parties to only what they strictly require.
  - **Purpose**  -To prevent over-sharing of personal data across services and ensure privacy at every step of the identity lifecycle.
  - **How MOSIP implements it**  -MOSIP’s modular architecture ensures that different modules (e.g., Registration, ID Authentication) only access and process the subset of identity data they need for their specific tasks. For example:
    - The Registration Client only collects demographic and biometric data required for enrolment.
    - Authentication services only verify the attributes requested by the relying party without exposing the full identity.

- Anonymization
  - **What it is**  -Anonymization removes or masks personal identifiers to make it impossible to link data back to an individual.
  - **Purpose**  -To ensure privacy in scenarios like analytics, system monitoring, and reporting where identification isn’t necessary.
  - **How MOSIP implements it**  -Audit logs and analytics data in MOSIP are anonymized by stripping or pseudonymizing personally identifiable information (PII), ensuring privacy even in post-processing environments.

- Need to Know
  - **What it is**  -This principle limits access to personal data only to the individuals, modules, or systems that require it for their roles.
  - **Purpose**  -To reduce the risk of unauthorized access and exposure of sensitive information.
  - **How MOSIP implements it**  -MOSIP enforces Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and fine-grained permissions across modules. For example:
      - Biometric data is accessible only to the modules responsible for deduplication and authentication.
      - Administrative users can only view logs relevant to their operational scope.

- Encryption
  - **What it is**  -Encryption secures sensitive data by converting it into an unreadable format accessible only with the right cryptographic keys.
  - **Purpose**  -To safeguard sensitive identity data from unauthorized access, breaches, or interception during storage and transmission.
  - **How MOSIP implements it**
    - MOSIP uses encryption algorithms such as: RSA,Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC),JSON Web Encryption (JWE) 
    - Secure key management is enforced through **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)** for cryptographic key storage and usage.

- Tokenization
  - **What it is**  -Tokenization substitutes sensitive data elements with randomly generated tokens to reduce direct exposure of real identifiers during system operations.
  - **Purpose**  -To protect sensitive identifiers like UINs during processing and interaction between modules.
  - **How MOSIP implements it**  -In MOSIP, sensitive identifiers (such as UIN) are tokenized during authentication or API interactions to ensure the original identifiers are not exposed to external systems.

### 2. Security

Security is a foundational principle ensuring the protection of the system, user data, and transactions from unauthorized access, breaches, and malicious attacks.

By embedding strong security practices, MOSIP achieves:

- 🔒 Protection of sensitive identity data from external and internal threats
- 🧑‍💻 Resilience against cyberattacks and unauthorized system usage
- 🌐 Trust and confidence for governments, system integrators, and end-users

This robust security framework enables MOSIP to function as a reliable backbone for national ID systems deployed worldwide.

MOSIP implements its security framework through the following key sub-elements:

- Data Security
  - **What it is**  -Data security ensures that all data handled by MOSIP—whether in storage or while processing—is safeguarded against unauthorized access, tampering, or breaches.
  - **Purpose**  -To prevent data leaks, ensure confidentiality and integrity, and protect user identities throughout their lifecycle.
**How MOSIP implements it**  -MOSIP adopts a multi-layered security approach to protect sensitive data:
    - **Encryption & Decryption** – Encryption is achieved using algorithms such as RSA, EC, and JWE.
    - **Hashing** – Sensitive elements like biometric templates are hashed with secure algorithms.
    - **HSM-backed Key Management** – Cryptographic keys are securely managed using Hardware Security Modules.
    - **Database Security** – Role-based permissions and audit trails monitor access.

- Trusted Applications
  - **What it is**  -Trusted applications refer to MOSIP’s mechanism to ensure that only verified and authorized software can interact with core modules and services.
  - **Purpose**  -To prevent unverified, potentially malicious applications from accessing sensitive APIs or data within MOSIP.
  - **How MOSIP implements it**  -MOSIP uses several mechanisms to ensure only authorized applications interact with the identity system:
    - **API Key Management** – Each external application accessing MOSIP APIs is registered and issued secure API keys.
    - **Digital Certificates** – Mutual TLS (mTLS) ensures both MOSIP and external applications verify each other’s identity.
    - **Sandbox Environments** – Applications are tested and validated in a sandbox before production deployment.

- Access Control
  - **What it is**  -Access control manages who can view, modify, or use specific data and system functions within MOSIP.
  - **Purpose**  -To ensure that only authorized personnel and system components can access sensitive data or perform privileged operations.
  - **How MOSIP implements it**  -MOSIP enforces strict access policies through:
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Defines roles (e.g., admin, registrar, operator) with precise permissions.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege** – Grants users/modules only the minimum access necessary for their tasks.
    - **Audit Trails** – Tracks and logs all access attempts and changes for monitoring and compliance.
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Adds an additional layer of protection for administrative access.

### 3. User Centricity

User Centricity means putting individuals at the heart of the identity system. It ensures that users are empowered to control their data, understand how it’s used, and interact with the system in ways that are inclusive, usable, and respectful of their privacy.
